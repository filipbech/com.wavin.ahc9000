You need an extra device to make your Wavin AHC 9000 smart and homey compatible. You can find the device here: https://www.ustepper.com/shop/#!/products/esphome-modbus-module and the software to put on it here: https://github.com/nic6911/Wavin-AHC-9000-mqtt. 

You need an MQTT broker somewhere. A good fit is the MQTT Broker you can install in homey. Find that here: https://homey.app/en-us/app/nl.scanno.mqttbroker/MQTT-Broker/. Configure the MQTT connection from the App-settings.
