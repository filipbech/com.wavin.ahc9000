# Wavin AHC 9000

You need an extra device to make your Wavin AHC 9000 smart and homey compatible. You can find the [device](https://www.ustepper.com/shop/#!/products/esphome-modbus-module) and the [software to put on it](https://github.com/nic6911/Wavin-AHC-9000-mqtt).

You need an MQTT broker somewhere. A good fit is the [MQTT Broker you can install in homey](https://homey.app/en-us/app/nl.scanno.mqttbroker/MQTT-Broker/). Configure the MQTT connection from the App-settings.
